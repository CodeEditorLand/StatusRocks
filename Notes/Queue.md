# Intro:

Queue-Optimized Database

- Workload:

    - Append-heavy for logging operations.
    - Sequential reads (e.g., processing or replaying queue data).

- Priority:

    - Write throughput.
    - Efficient sequential reads.
    - Less emphasis on random read performance or query efficiency.

# Config:

## Optimize for Write Performance

1. Increase `write_buffer_size` to hold larger batches of data in memory before
   flushing to disk.

```sh
options.write_buffer_size = 64 * 1024 * 1024
// Example: 64 MB
```

2. Adjust `max_write_buffer_number` to allow multiple in-memory buffers for
   concurrent writes.

```sh
options.max_write_buffer_number = 4
// Allow 4 buffers
```

3. Increase `min_write_buffer_number_to_merge` to reduce frequent memtable
   flushes.

```sh
options.min_write_buffer_number_to_merge = 2
```

4. Enable WAL (Write-Ahead Log) for durability but optimize its behavior for
   queues:

```sh
options.wal_dir = "/path/to/wal"
// Separate WAL directory
```

```sh
Consider DB::WriteOptions.sync:
Use sync = false for higher throughput if durability is not critical.
Use sync = true for guaranteed persistence but at the cost of write performance.
```

5. Enable `use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction` for efficient `I/O` during
   flush and compaction.

```sh
options.use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction = true
```

## Optimize for Sequential Reads

1. Increase `block_cache_size` to improve read performance by caching frequently
   accessed data.

```sh
options.block_cache = NewLRUCache(512 * 1024 * 1024);
// 512 MB cache
```

2. Enable readahead for sequential access patterns:

```sh
options.compaction_readahead_size = 2 * 1024 * 1024
// 2 MB readahead
```

3. Use bloom filters for faster key lookups:

```sh
options.prefix_extractor.reset(NewFixedPrefixTransform(8));
// Example for 8-byte prefixes
```

```sh
options.memtable_prefix_bloom_size_ratio = 0.1
// 10% of memtable size
```

## Adjust Compaction Settings

1. Use `kLevel` compaction for better space efficiency and predictable
   performance.

```sh
options.compaction_style = rocksdb::kCompactionStyleLevel
```

2. Increase `target_file_size_base` to reduce the frequency of compaction.

```sh
options.target_file_size_base = 64 * 1024 * 1024
// 64 MB
```

3. Use `max_background_compactions` to control compaction thread usage.

```sh
options.max_background_compactions = 4
// Allow up to 4 background threads
```

## Manage Disk I/O and Durability

1. Deploy RocksDB on SSDs or NVMe drives for higher IOPS.

2. Place WAL, SSTables, and temporary files on separate disks to avoid
   contention:

```sh
options.db_paths = {"/path/to/data", "/path/to/secondary"}
```

3. Enable lightweight compression like Snappy to reduce disk usage without heavy
   CPU overhead.

```sh
options.compression = rocksdb::kSnappyCompression
```

## Tune for Queue Characteristics

1. Use DeleteRange or TTL (Time-To-Live) for queue-like data that expires over
   time.

```sh
options.ttl = 3600
// Example: 1-hour TTL
```

2. Use batch writes to reduce overhead:

```cpp
WriteBatch batch;

for (auto& op : operations) {
    batch.Put(op.key, op.value);
}

db->Write(write_options, &batch);
```

## Monitoring and Profiling

1. Use RocksDB Statistics: Enable statistics to monitor performance:

```sh
options.statistics = rocksdb::CreateDBStatistics();
```

2. Analyze Bottlenecks: Use tools like perf, RocksDB's internal metrics, or
   monitoring frameworks to identify slowdowns.
